# MarcoSmilesVR

## Project Overview

MarcoSmiles was conceived in 2016 within the Laboratory of Musimatics at the University of Salerno,
with the ambitious aim of exploring new techniques of human-computer interaction in the context of musical performances. This innovative platform is characterised by the possibility to fully customise the performance of a virtual musical instrument through the natural movement of the hands. MarcoSmiles integrates a MIDI management module, allowing the system to be used with any device equipped with a MIDI interface.

The integration of virtual reality provides MarcoSmiles with a significant advantage,
transforming the musical experience into an immersive experience. 
Users can have the opportunity to experiment with music in an immersive three-dimensional environment,
which attempts to reproduce a recording studio as faithfully as possible, where hand movements become the means to explore and shape one's own musical creation.
This fusion of technology and virtual reality amplifies human-machine interaction,
enabling a deeper connection between the user and the system. In this context, 
virtual reality is not just an upgrade but a transformation that elevates MarcoSmiles to a higher 
level of musical expression and opens up different scenarios for improvement.

## New Features
In previous versions, one or more _Leap Motion_ was used to capture hand information. 
However, this dynamic has changed in the VR version, where the use of different technologies 
related to the augmented reality visor, including the **integrated hand tracking functionality**, 
enables a new approach. Now, instead of using an additional device such as the Leap Motion, 
**the system makes use of the hand tracking subsystem already built into the visor**.

Another fundamental evolution concerns the **restructuring of the neural network** used, 
with a specific focus on the **type of learning implemented**. In the current version, 
we have abandoned the traditional approach to embrace a more advanced model: **reinforcement learning,
with a special emphasis on the implementation of Q-learning**.
